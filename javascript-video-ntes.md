**Video 1:**

The video was on a beginner\'s guide. This course will help us to
understand what the syntax is and what the code means for the next time
when we look at JavaScript.

**Video 2:**

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. JavaScript is everywhere
(i.e Client, Server, Native Applications), Every popular platform is
using it.

**Video 3:**

JavaScript has access to **DOM (Document Object Model)**.On Client side,
JavaScript running on browser uses **script tags** & JavaScript running
on server requires [**[Node.js]{.underline}**](http://node.js) to be
installed for building web services.

**Video 4:**

JavaScript can be written in VS Code, Extensions are used to find & fix
problems, code formatter, and to avoid redundant typings.
[[Node.js]{.underline}](http://node.js) is JavaScript for runtime we can
execute JS code outside the web browser, NVM is the tool we use to
install and update [[Node.js]{.underline}](http://node.js)

**Video 5:**

This video was about the installation of toolbox for JavaScript

**Video 6:**

We use Console Log in [[Node.js]{.underline}](http://node.js), console
log is simply a space in a web-browser where the errors or information
is displayed but in [[Node.js]{.underline}](http://node.js) it appears
where we run it. For declaring strings ("" or '') are used, Template
Literal (\`\`) is used to pass the string parameters (\`\${greeting}\`)

**Video 7:**

There are two types of comments that help coders / developers to write
their code and to add some line to know what the function means (// for
single & /\* \*/ for multi code comments or **Ctrl + /**). Comments are
used to make the code cleaner and easier to explain, understand.

**Video 8:**

In this video, I learned the implementation of single line comments &
multiline comments.

We use them to make code easier to understand for any other developer
also, for self documenting the code it is the better approach to go
with.

**Video 9:**

There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript (**var, let,
const**). Var is available anywhere in the code, let is available only
after declaration and can be changed in scope, const value can not be
changed it is also available only after declaration.

**Video 10:**

This video explained the implementation of all the three variables of
Javascript in VS Code using Node js.

**Video 11:**

Strings are used to represent textual elements. Concatenation is used to
combine variables or strings by **'+'** operator.

**Video 12:**

This video shows the demonstration of Strings in Code. Example
(str1+str2) will result in helloworld, (Str1 + "Big" + Str2) will result
in hello Big world.

**Video 13:**

This video helped me learn using template literals to format strings.
Strings can be formatted either via concentration (+) or by template
literals, We have the placeholders to insert values of strings in
expression using template literals.

**Video 14:**

Demonstration of Template Literals was explained in this video.

**Video 15:**

JavaScript is weakly typed and also has some special types (i.e NAN,
null, undefined). Two kinds of checking types were explained in this
**typeof** operator, **instanceof** operator.

**Video 16:**

In this video, I learned the implementation of Data Types of JavaScript
using arrays\[\], using simple variables and then displaying the results
in console.log(typeof people). It is used to return the datatypes of
variables etc whereas **Instanceof** returns the boolean output as (true
or false).

**Video 17:**

We can also add Maths in JavaScript, We can simple do it as (num1 \*
num2) . There are also some additional mathematical operators such as
increment (++), decrement (\--) & remainder (%), we can also perform
Trigonometry and Logarithms also in JavaScript.

**Video 18:**

This video helped me understand the implementation and working of Maths
Operations in JavaScript.

**Video 19:**

In Javascript if we want to convert the strings into numbers we can do
that by using {**parseInt() , parseFloat()**} both of these convert the
numerical strings to numbers **.toString()** is simple used to convert
the numbers into numerical strings**.**

**Video 20:**

This video helped me understand the implementation and working of
Conversions (numeric to strings & strings to numeric) in JavaScript with
the live examples.

**Video 21:**

In order to tackle when the things go wrong in software development we
can handle errors in JavaScript. The problems that occur are Exception,
Error and Throwing to handle all these we can use **Try, Catch &
Finally** in JavaScript.

**Video 22:**

This video helped me to implement and understand error handlings in
JavaScript such as Exception, Error Throwing. Now I've learned how to
implement all these concepts in JavaScript code to tackle all the
problems.

**Video 23:**

Time is a JavaScript Object. There are different types of constructors
to format date according to specific need. For month the counting starts
from 0 (i.e 0 is for January).

**Video 24:**

I've learned the different date formats and their constructors via this
demo. When we call the current date using (=new Date()) it has a
generalized method YYYY-MM-DD Time (UTC),

If we use .setMonth() it will automatically updates that specific month
to the **new Date().**

**Video 25:**

In this video, we learn about the operators in javascript. Like in other
languages javascript uses the same operators for less than and greater
than values, but there is an exception in equal to and not equal to
operators. The (== , !=) operators only check the value regardless of
the data type but the (=== , !==) operators check the value and data
type. We also study about the different ways to write an if-else
statement.

**Video 26:**

This video taught us about the different ways of writing an if else
statement. We can use the old and most used way where you define the
"if" and " else if statements", or if there is a single line we tend to
eliminate the curly braces. The third way is the ternary statement in
which there are no blocks of if else just a single line that does the
thing.

**Video 27:**

We learned how JavaScript handles the default values of different types
of variables. We learned about how single and double logical operators
work. Single logical operators check both the values, while double
logical operators check only the first operand if it gives the answer to
them. Later on, we studied the switch statement, how it handles the
different cases, and how it is different from the if-else statements.

**Video 28:**

In this video, we implemented the code about the concepts that we
learned in the previous video. We learned how uppercase and lowercase
strings are different from each other and how JavaScript solves the
implicit values of data types. We learned how switch statements are
different from if statements. The only difference between switch and if
statements is that in if statements, you can deal with a value that is
greater than or less than a certain value, but in switch statements, you
only refer to that exact value.

**Video 29:**

In this video, we learned what arrays are, how to create an array, and
what the length function is in an array.Arrays are basically a
collection or a list of many values. The values can be of different data
types, and whenever a value is added into an array, it is assigned a
number, which is basically an index of the number, which is used to
access that particular value in that array.The length function of the
array tells the length of the array.

**Video 30:**

In this video, we learned about the two ways of creating an array. In
the first method, we declared a variable named array1 and passed no size
to it, meaning it has zero size. In the second method, we used an array
object and passed the size of the object in the parenthesis.

**Video 31:**

In this video, we learned about how to add values in the array. We can
add the value in the array when the array is being created or when it
has been created. We will learn that the length of the array is the
total sum of spaces the array has been allocated and the index of the
array is a particular number that points to a specific space in the
array. The length of the array is always greater than the index.

**Video 32:**

In this video, we implemented the code about the concepts we discussed
in the previous video. We learned about populating the array during the
creation of array and populating the array after its creation.

**Video 33:**

In this video, we learnt about the methods of arrays like push, pop,
shift, unshift which add and remove value from the front and end of
array and concat method which combines the arrays

**Video 34:**

In this video, we implemented the code of the previous concepts. We
learnt how to manipulate arrays using their method functions like push,
pop, shift, unshift, and concat.

**Video 35:**

In this video, I learned about loops, how and why they are used. I also
learned about the three types of loops and their syntax, and which loop
to use in different conditions.

**Video 36:**

In this video, we implemented the code of for, while and for of loop. We
learned how they are different from each other.

**Video 37:**

In this video, we learned about the functions. Functions are used to
make code manageable and concise. We learned about the syntax of
functions and learned about their naming conventions. We learned the
function\'s parameters and how functions return values.

**Video 38:**

This video helped me understand how we can write a function. It helped
me understand how functions are named and how they are invoked and
called. It told me how javascript understands parameters and exits the
function at a return value.

**Video 39:**

This video tells us that arrow functions are used to define a function
in a shorter way. We use arrow functions when functions are passed as
callbacks. It tells us that arrow functions return implicit values if it
is a single line of code. It does not need a return statement

**Video 40:**

This video actually implements the code of arrow functions. It shows how
arrow functions make the code manageable. It tells how arrow functions
return implicit and explicit values.

**Video 41:**

In this video, we learned that JSON is an easy way of representing data
in key value pairs. It is used to communicate the data between client
and server. JSON is actually a text and is very easy to transfer data
between applications. The video also tells that how can we convert JSON
object to string and a string to JSON object.

**Video 42:**

This video demonstrates the code of JSON in javascript. It tells us how
can we access and structure data using key-value pairs and arrays. It
also tells us about how to store and use data in JSON.

**Video 43:**

In this video, we learned about the javascript object. We learned that
the object has its own attributes and method actions which are just
function definitions. We are learned about the new() keyboard which just
creates an instance of the object and the this() keyword which points to
that object.

**Video 44:**

This video tells us about JavaScript objects. It tells us what the
method functions and attributes of the object are. It tells us how we
use them and also talks about the generation of an object from an object
literal and from a constructor.

**Video 45:**

In this video we learned that if we make a call to the database, server,
or do some complex problems, our application can freeze as these take a
long time. So, we use promises, which allow the code to run without
freezing while completing that particular task, like fetching from the
database.

**Video 46:**

This video demonstrates the concept of promises using code. It tells us
how promises help javascript run the entire code without stopping at the
long operations

**Video 47:**

This video tells us how async/await helps promises to make the
application smoother. Instead of writing long "then" statements we write
async/await for asynchronous activities. When a function returns a
promise it waits for a little bit, calculates and then returns the
value.

**Video 48:**

In this video, we implemented the code of async/await in JavaScript.
Async/await helps the promises to continue the asynchronous activities
without blocking the whole code.

**Video 49:**

This video tells us about package management. It tells us that packages
are reusable code which a person can use for their own development. It
also tells us about the types of dependencies like dependencies and
devdependencies.

**Video 50:**

This video explains how we install the package.json file in our
application. It also explains how we install dependencies in our code
and use those packages for our needs.

**Video 51:**

This video tells us that after learning from this platform, we should go
and implement the knowledge and build something.
